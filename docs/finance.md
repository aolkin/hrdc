# Welcome to the HRDC Finances and Accounting Portal

The HRDC Financial Manager web portal provides an easy way to maintain records
of your grants, budget, and expenses in collaboration with the HRDC board
and your production supervisor.

The functionality of the financial manager is divided into three parts, the
grants tracker, the budget spreadsheet, and the expenses tracker. On the home
page of the financial manager, you should see a list of every show you are an
executive staff member on that has the financial manager enabled, with your
current expected, reported, and actual balances.

#### A Note on Terminology:

> Your budget is divided into three columns, "Estimate", "Reported", and
> "Actual". The estimate column on your budget is for planning your expenses
> and corresponds to your "requested" grants. The difference of those is your
> expected balance. The reported budget column is for tracking how much you
> think you have spent, and corresponds with your "received" grants. Together,
> those make up your reported balance. Your actual balance will be updated
> automatically as grant funds come in and purchases are logged.

## Grants Tracker

The grants tracker is accessed via the "Grants and Income" link in the sidebar
under each show. You are responsible for inputting each grant you apply for
(or plan to apply for), and updating the amount and status as you apply for the
grant. When you receive a grant, make sure to input the amount received and
update the status.

The treasurer will mark the grant as confirmed when the funds are received by
the HRDC, and then the grant will move from the "Pending" section to the
"Confirmed" section and will no longer be editable.

The grants form will always display a single blank grant at the bottom of the
page. To add more, just fill it in and hit "Save", and a new blank line will
appear.

Note that even though your income is displayed on the budget page, you can only
update it via the grants tracker.

## Budget

The budget page functions like a spreadsheet, and is where you define your
expense categories and plan your spending, as well as getting an overview of
your show's actual spending. Unlike the income and expenses trackers, the budget
page autosaves, so there is no need to press a "Save" button.

Your income will be displayed at the top of the page, but cannot be edited here.
At the bottom you will see your total income and expenses, as well as your net
balance. The expenses portion of your budget page is divided into three primary
categories, "Administrative" (printing, publicity, etc), "Production" (scenic,
paint, sound, etc), and "Other". Within these categories, you can create items
for each subcategory you expect to spend money on and estimate how much you will
spend.

As you actually start spending money, update the reported column with how much
you think you've spent, so you can get an idea of how much money you have left
to spend. Finally, the actual column will be updated automatically by the
expenses tracker.

#### Why can't I delete a budget line?

You can freely add and delete budget line items as long as they have no
associated expenses. Once you start logging expenses in the expenses tracker,
you will no longer be able to delete the category they are logged as. To delete
a budget line, you must first delete or change all associated expenses to
another subcategory.

## Expenses Tracker

The expenses tracker allows you to log and track every purchase you make, and
is also how you request reimbursement from the HRDC for purchases made with
your own money. Both p-card purchases and reimburseable purchases must be
entered into the expenses tracker, though in some cases your space supervisor
will enter p-card purchases for you.

All purchases must have the subcategory selected (from those you have listed on
your budget), the item description, the purchase amount, the purchaser, and the
date purchased. Depending on how the item was purchased, you may need to provide
additional information. As you log expenses, the actual column on the budget
will update, with each budget line showing the total expenses listed under that
subcategory.

### P-Card Purchases

For p-card purchases, either you or your production supervisor may enter them.
Initially, they will be listed under "New Expenses", but once your production
supervisor confirms them they will no longer be editable, and be listed under a
separate "P-Card Purchases" section. P-card purchases do not require any extra
information.

### Reimbursable Purchases

To enter a purchase made with personal funds and request reimbursement, select
"Personal Funds" from the "Purchased using" selector. You must then enter the
purchaser's email address, and make sure the purchaser name is as it should
appear on the check. You also have the option to request reimbursement via a
mailed check, in which case you will need to supply the mailing address.
In addition, you must supply a PDF or image of the purchase receipt in order to
request reimbursement.

After entering the purchase information, you MUST hit "Save Changes". You can
them come back to the item and edit it later as much as you'd like. (This also
means you can enter only some of the information and add the receipt later, for
example.) When you are ready and have checked that everything is correct, click
"Request Reimbursement". The expense will move to the "Requested Reimbursements"
section and you will no longer be able to edit it. Once the treasurer processes
the reimbursement, they will update its status.
