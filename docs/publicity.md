# Welcome to the HRDC Publicity Manager

The HRDC Publicity Manager web portal allows you to directly manage the
contents of your web page on the HRDC website, as well as the information that
will go in the HRDC newsletter.

It is also where you should maintain an up-to-date directory of show's entire
cast and staff, both for display on the website and for archival purposes.

# Editing your Show

When you log in to the website, you should see a list of shows you are an
executive staff member on. These are the shows you will be able to manage.

Under "HRDC Apps for PDSMs", you should be able to navigate to "Show
Publicity", where you will again see your shows listed in the sidebar.

Once the publicity coordinator has set up your webpage and linked it to the
publicity manager, any changes you make within the publicity manager will be
live as soon as you hit "Save Changes".

## General Information

Most information related to your show will be updated on the "Show Info" page.

If items are left blank, they will either be omitted, or in some cases listed
as "TBD".

#### Masthead Credits

Masthead credits should include the author and composer (if applicable), as
well as the director and other executive staff members. The reccomended
format is:

> Written by Author's Name
>
> Directed by Director's Name '20
>
> Produced by Producer 1 '19, Producer 2 '22
>
> ...etc

#### Email for Publicity

This email address will be listed as a contact email for questions. We suggest
you use your @shows.hrdctheater.org email account for this purpose.

#### About the Show

Your primary blurb and text space on the page. Any links or email addresses
you include in this box will be clickable.

#### Runtime

The show's runtime, e.g. "1 hour w/ 10 minute intermission", "90 minutes". If
this is left blank, the webpage will say "Runtime: TBD".

#### Term for Pit Musicians

If your show is a musical or otherwise includes a corps of musicians, select the
header that should be used for them. You must select a value other than "Not
Applicable" for "Band" personnel to show up on the webpage, but they will be
referred to via whatever term you select.

### Performance Dates

You can list as many performance dates as needed, and add and remove them at
will. A date and time picker will pop up when you select one of the inputs to
ensure the date and time are formatted correctly, as it will not save if they
are not.

You can also list a note for each performance date, such as "Free with HUID"
or similar. The note will be displayed in parentheses next to the date and time.

## Personnel List

Please list everyone involved in your show, from executive staff to build crew
to cast members to pit musicians.

The directory editor will always display all of the people you have already
added, plus one blank person at the bottom, so after adding each person just
hit "Save Changes" to be able to add another.

Most fields should be fairly self-explanatory. You must include the person's
role or position, name, and year if applicable.

The "Type" selector controls whether the given person will appear in the "Cast",
"Staff", or "Musician" section on the webpage, or for people listed in the
masthead that you do not wish to duplicate, you may select "Hidden". The heading
that will be used for the "Musicians" section is selectable on the "Show Info"
page.

By default, people will be listed in the order you add them, and you may ignore
the order field. However, to control the ordering of the list, simply supply a
number in the order field, and people will be sorted from lowest to highest
order.

For ensemble roles or large crew positions, list each individual separately. The
system will combine them and display them together in the cast or crew list.
You can also omit the "Role or Position" field if desired, for shows with a
purely ensemble cast of performers.

# The Preview Page

If your show is enabled in the publicity manager, but not yet linked to the
public website, you can use the preview page to view what your show will look
like on the website.

Note that once your show is linked to the public site, all changes will appear
there immediately upon being saved.

# Help and Support

If your shows appear on the home page but not in the publicity manager,
talk to the [publicity coordinator](mailto:publicity@hrdctheater.org) to
have them enabled.

If you run into problems or have a question about how to use this site, please
email [support@app.hrdctheater.org](mailto:support@app.hrdctheater.org). If you
encounter an error, please include when the error occurred, and as much
specific information about what happened as possible.
