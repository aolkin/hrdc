The HRDC Apps site was originally created and maintained by Aaron Olkin, 2018
HRDC Treasurer and 2019 HRDC Vice President, Harvard College Class of 2020.

His contact info can be found hidden at the bottom of the "Site Administration"
portal home page, in case of emergency. Hopefully said emergency doesn't
prevent reaching that page.
